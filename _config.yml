  I am a young researcher working in the field of Data Mining with 2 years of experience working at the 
    [Data Mining Lab](http://dminer.eecs.yorku.ca/) @ Lassonde School of Engineering, York University Toronto. 
    I love working with Spatial Data sets for which I use PostgreSQL & PostGIS and Python to extract insights.
    I typically visualize data sets along the way to understand the pipelines and models I'm creating.
    
    
    I have also worked on a project related to Cloud Computing @ Uppsala University, Sweden. 
    
    Currently I'm working under the supervision [Prof. Manos Papagelis](https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~papaggel/).
