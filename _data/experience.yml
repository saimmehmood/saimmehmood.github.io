    The research was related to trajectory data mining, machine learning, and statistical inference. 
    
    We developed a method that utilizes trajectories to learn low-dimensional representations of geographical areas
    that the trajectories span in an embedded space. The method relies on random-walk based approaches for learning 
    node representation of a graph and is able to reveal latent relationships of geographical areas, effectively defining semantic relationships between them.

    These latent semantic relationships can improve our understanding of how space is perceived by individuals (through their trajectories) 
    and inform better decisions of urban planning etc.

    We published the research titled [**Learning Semantic Relationships of Geographical Areas based on Trajectories**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162305)
    at the IEEE MDM 2020 Conference and received Best Paper Award.

    Designed a framework inside SNIC using **Apache Spark, SparkR & Jupyter Notebook** to simplify computations of highly parallel scientific applications. 
    
    Our project enabled researchers to seamlessly deploy their applications on the spark server and scale it to multiple worker nodes as needed.
