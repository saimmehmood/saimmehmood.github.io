    •	The research was related to trajectory data mining, machine learning, and statistical inference.

    •	Developed a method that utilizes trajectories of [cars, pedestrians, etc.] as a way to infer semantic similarities between geographical areas.

    •	Published the research titled [**Learning Semantic Relationships of Geographical Areas based on Trajectories**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9162305)
    at the IEEE Mobile Data Management Conference 2020 Versailles, France, and received Best Paper Award.

    •	Designed a framework inside SNIC using **Apache Spark, SparkR & Jupyter Notebook** to simplify computations of highly parallel scientific applications. 
    
    •	Our project titled [**Towards Moving Scientific Applications in the Cloud**](https://github.com/saimmehmood/Towards-Moving-Scientific-Applications-in-the-Cloud) enabled researchers to seamlessly deploy their applications on the spark server and scale it to multiple worker nodes as needed.
