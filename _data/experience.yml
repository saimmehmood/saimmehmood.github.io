    - My research is related to **trajectory data mining, location-based services** and **recommender systems**. 

    - Building semantic relationships of city neighborhoods, based on mapping the trajectories of users through GPS.

    - Dividing a city into a geographic grid, we examine the paths that users take through the city's grid cells at different times of day and days of the week. We can then cluster grid cells with similar trajectories according to their semantic properties (e.g., office workers all visit the same grid cell at 9 am on weekdays). 
    
    - This makes it possible to develop a completely crowdsourced, location-based recommender system that suggest points of interest to a user based on where they have recently visited.

    - Designed a framework inside SNIC using **Apache Spark, SparkR & Jupyter Notebook** to simplify computations of highly parallel scientific applications. 
    
    - Our project enabled researchers to seamlessly deploy their applications on the spark server and scale it to multiple worker nodes as needed.
